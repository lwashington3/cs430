		A vertex that is has no edges (is not connected to anything) is isolated.%
		\footnote{In a directed graph, if the only connection a node has is to itself (a self-loop), then it is still considered isolated.}
		The difference between how an edge set $E$ is denoted for an undirected graph versus a directed graph is that the directed graph is a tuple (where order matters) while an undirected graph is a set (where order doesn't matter).
		Self-loops are not allowed in an undirected graphs.
	\end{answer}
	\item Define these terms:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Vertex $v$ is adjacent to vertex $u$ in an undirected graph.
		\begin{answer} There is an edge $\{ u, v\}$ (which is equivalent to $\{ v, u\}$). \end{answer}
		\item Vertex $v$ is adjacent to vertex $u$ in a directed graph.
		\begin{answer} $(u,v): u\rightarrow v$, which is not the same as $(v,u)$. \end{answer}
		\item The degree of a vertex in an undirected graph.
		\begin{answer} The number of edges touching the vertex. \end{answer}
		\item The degree of a vertex in a directed graph.
		\begin{answer} There are two types of degrees.
			\begin{description}
				\item[Out Degree] The number of edges leaving the vertex.
				\item[In Degree] The number of edges entering the vertex.
			\end{description}
			The total degree is the sum of the In Degrees and Out Degrees.
		\end{answer}
		\item A path in an undirected graph.
		\begin{answer} Sequences of edges from a vertex to a vertex where the reuse of edges is okay. \end{answer}
		\item A path in a directed graph.

		\item The length of a path.
		\begin{answer} The number of edges on the path. \end{answer}
		\item $v$ is reachable from $u$.
		\begin{answer} There is a path from $u$ to $v$. \end{answer}
		\item A simple path.
		\begin{answer} A path with no reused vertices OR edges.\end{answer}
		\item A cycle in an undirected graph.
		What about a simple cycle?
		\begin{answer} The path from a vertex to itself.
		A simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't reuse vertices or edges to get back to the original vertex
		(simple path back to the same vertex).\end{answer}
		\item A cycle in a directed graph.
		What about a simple cycle?
		\begin{answer} The path in the ordered direction from a vertex to itself. \end{answer}
		\item Acyclic graph.
		\begin{answer} No cycles in the graph. \end{answer}
		\item Connected undirected graph.
		\begin{answer} Every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. \end{answer}
		\item Connected directed graph.
		\begin{answer} Also known as a strongly connected graph.
		Every vertex is reachable (along edges in the correct direction) from every other vertex.\end{answer}
		\item Bipartite Graph.
		\begin{answer} Separate the vertices into 2 sets.
		All edges go between the 2 sets.
		There are no edges between vertices in the same set.\end{answer}

	\begin{answer}Memory: $O(|V| + |E|)$.
	Find if edge exists: $O(|V|)$.
	Remember, the amount of memory needed for the undirected graph is greater for the undirected graph than the directed graph,
	since each edge in the undirected graph is represented twice, while each edge in the directed graph is represented once.
	Find the path using the adjacency list is $O(|V|^{2})$.\end{answer}

	\item How do the two implementations handle a weighted graph?
	\oldanswer{Edges have numbers, add weights to the adj list and adj matrix.}
	\item Two different representations of the graph data structure are discussed in the book, adjacency-list and adjacency-matrix.
	Please briefly discuss the runtime (in terms of $|V|$ and $|E$ of these graph operations/algorithms using each implementation.)
	Assume vertices are labeled as integers.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What is the worst-case big-O runtime for checking to see if an edge from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ exists?
		\oldanswer{Adj list: $O(V)$, Adj matrix: $O(1)$}

\section{Graph Traversals}\label{sec:graph-traversals}
A way to search/visit all the vertices in a graph.
There is not a unique answer usually.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Undirected graph - if connected, all vertices will be visited.
	\item Directed graph - Must be strongly connected to be able to visit all vertices.
\end{itemize}

Breadth first - visit vertices one edge from a given (or random) source, two edges from source, etc.
Uses a queue and some way to make a vertex (white initially, gray when first visited and put in queue, black when out of queue),
label a vertex how far from the source, and label a vertex with how its predecessor vertex was during the traversal.

\begin{enumerate}[start=8]
    \item Perform a breadth first search on this graph.
