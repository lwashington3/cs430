\section{Proving a Greedy Choice Property}\label{sec:proving-a-greedy-choice-property}
To prove a Greedy Choice Property for a problem (that local optimal choice leads to global optimal solution) use the following ``cut and paste'' proof.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[ ]
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
        \item Assume you have an optimal answer that does not contain the greedy choice you are trying to prove.
        \item Show that you can ``cut'' something out of that optimal answer and ``paste'' in the greedy choice you are trying to prove. Therefore either the assumed optimal answer already contained the greedy choice, or you can make the assumed optimal contain the greedy choice.
        \item Therefore there is always an optimal answer that contains the greedy choice (can be continued like an inductive proof).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\vspace*{1em}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item Try various ``common sense'' greedy approaches that divide the problem into a sub-problem(s) and try to come up with counter-examples or prove te greedy choice is correct.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Does every Optimization Problem exhibit Optimal Substructure?}\label{sec:does-every-optimization-problem-exhibit-optimal-substructure?}
Consider the following two problems in which we are given a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ and vertices $u, v \in V$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item[ ]
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
        \item Un-weighted shortest path: Find a path from $u$ to $v$ consisting of the fewest edges.
        \item Un-weighted longest simple path: Find a simple path from $u$ to $v$ consisting of the most edges.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.,start=2]
    \item Try to prove Optimal Substructure for the above two problems.
    \item Why does optimal substructure fail for some optimization problems?
\end{enumerate}
